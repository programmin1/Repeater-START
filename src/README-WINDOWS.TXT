This is the Windows Version of Repeater-START (Showing The Amateur Repeaters Tool)
The repeaters app is using the repeater listing at https://hearham.com/repeaters

This works like the Linux version of Repeater-START, however:
 * No "locate me" button as Geoclue is a Linux library
 * Much larger app with GTK libraries included. May pause briefly upon initial opening.
 
Running the program:
 * Unzip this whole directory.
 * Double Click the "repeaterstart.exe" within the directory.
 
You may right click, create shortcut, name it "Repeaters" or "Map", then drag
the shortcut to your desktop for easy access.

Files:
The settings, stored repeater list, and files are stored in
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\repeater-START
